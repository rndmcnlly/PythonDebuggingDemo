# PythonDebugDemo

This project is intended to illustrate using a debugger for Python inside of VSCode.

Suggested demonstration:
- Start the server (via the VSCode Run and Debug panel)
- View http://localhost:5000/
- Refresh many times until you see the angry bee
- Use the mouse to set a breakpoint at the top of `demo`
- Add a watch for `countdown`
- Step through execution line by line, observing variable values
- Remove the breakpoint
- add `breakpoint()` before the bee launcher
- Refresh until it is hit
